# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for predicting the landing outcome of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage. The project involves data collection, exploratory data analysis, and the application of various machine learning models to predict whether the first stage will successfully land.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.jupyterlite.ipynb**: Main notebook for machine learning prediction.
- **jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
- **jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb**: Notebook for SQL-based exploratory data analysis.
- **jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb**: Notebook for data collection using SpaceX API.
- **jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb**: Notebook for web scraping SpaceX launch data.
- **lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb**: Notebook for analyzing launch site locations.
- **spacex_dash_app.py**: Python script for a Dash application to visualize SpaceX launch data.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn dash

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Use the `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb` and `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb` notebooks to collect and preprocess the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the `jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb` and `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb` notebooks to perform exploratory data analysis.
3. **Machine Learning Prediction**: Use the `SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.jupyterlite.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate machine learning models.
4. **Visualization**: Use the `spacex_dash_app.py` script to run a Dash application for visualizing the data.
